# What is this?
This is a GitHub repository used to generate the public documentation of the radio repeaters made available by [Able Nation](https://able-nation.org), [Able Shepherd](https://ableshepherd.com), and [Stand in the Gap Initiative](https://StandInTheGapInitiative.com).

Here's the resulting [public website](https://ableshepherdrepeaters.github.io/).
